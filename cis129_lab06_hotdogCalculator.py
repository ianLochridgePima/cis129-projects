Hotdog Cookout Lab:
Students will be provided the Pseudocode, then they are to create this in Python.

Hot Dog Cookout Calculator

Assume that hot dogs come in packages of 10, and hot dog buns come in packages of 8. 
Design a modular program that calculates the number of packages of hot dogs and the number of 
packages of hot dog buns needed for a cookout, with the minimum amount of leftovers. 
The program should ask the user for the number of people attending the cookout, and the 
number of hot dogs each person will be given. The program should display the following:

1. The minimum number of packages of hot dogs required.
2. The minimum number of packages of buns required
3. The number of hot dogs that will be left over
4. The number of buns that will be left over
